## üíª Setup & Usage

1. **Access the Application**:
   - Visit [https://air-monitoring-dashboard.vercel.app/](https://air-monitoring-dashboard.vercel.app/)
   - Login with provided credentials or create a new account

2. **View Air Quality Data**:
   - Monitor real-time AQI readings on the main dashboard
   - Check historical trends via line charts
   - View current status (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor)

3. **Configure Thresholds**:
   - Set custom alert thresholds for different pollutants
   - Adjust sensitivity based on your requirements

## üîÑ Integration with IoT Hardware

The dashboard connects with air quality sensors via Firebase Realtime Database:
- Sensors push data to Firebase in real-time
- Dashboard pulls and displays updated readings
- Threshold checks trigger alerts when conditions are met

When air quality metrics exceed configured thresholds, the system:
1. Displays visual alerts on the dashboard
2. Sends trigger signals to connected IoT devices
3. Activates physical alarms or mitigation systems

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- MQTT protocol implementation for more efficient IoT communication
- Mobile application for on-the-go monitoring
- Machine learning integration for predictive air quality forecasting
- Geospatial mapping to visualize air quality across different locations
- Notification system (email, SMS, push notifications) for critical alerts
- Advanced reporting capabilities with PDF export
